# Changelog

## [v3.0.11] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- Campaign lifecycle methods on `WorkspaceManager`: `archive_campaign()`,
  `restore_campaign()` and `delete_campaign()`.

  Campaigns have no independent existence in this data model. There is no campaign
  file and no campaign record: `list_campaigns()` derives its rows entirely from
  media plan files, keeping one row per `campaign_id` after archived *plans* have
  been filtered out at the SQL level. A campaign is therefore "archived" exactly
  when every one of its plans is, and it ceases to exist when its last plan is
  deleted. Every one of these methods is consequently a cascade over the campaign's
  media plans rather than a state transition on a campaign - not an implementation
  shortcut, but the only semantics the storage model can express.

  `archive_campaign()` archives all plans including the current one, via
  `MediaPlan.archive(allow_current=True)` - the parameter added in 3.0.5 for exactly
  this case, which preserves `is_current` rather than clearing it, so a later restore
  reinstates the same current plan with no re-election step.

  All three are non-atomic and continue-on-error: there is no transaction spanning
  file storage, Parquet and PostgreSQL, so one plan failing does not abandon the
  rest. Each returns `plans_changed` / `plans_skipped` / `plans_failed` and sets
  `success=False` if anything failed, rather than hiding a partial cascade. Re-running
  after a partial failure is safe - an already-archived plan is skipped, not errored.

  Two deliberate asymmetries with the plan-level methods, both documented in the
  docstrings so neither reads as an oversight:
  - `delete_campaign()` defaults `dry_run=True`, where `MediaPlan.delete()` defaults
    it to `False`. The cascade is N times more destructive and this is new API with
    no backwards-compatibility obligation to the riskier default.
  - `delete_campaign()` has no `allow_current_plan_deletion` parameter. Deleting a
    campaign means deleting its current plan too; a guard against that would make the
    method impossible to complete.

  `restore_campaign()` un-archives **every** archived plan in the campaign, not only
  those a previous `archive_campaign()` archived. Nothing in the data model records
  why a plan was archived, so a plan archived individually beforehand is restored too.
  This is an accepted tradeoff taken over adding a provenance field to the schema;
  callers needing a precise inverse should persist `archive_campaign()`'s
  `plans_changed` list and restore those plans individually via `MediaPlan.restore()`.

- `CampaignNotFoundError`, raised when a campaign lifecycle method is given a
  `campaign_id` no media plan carries. Kept distinct from `StorageError` (the same
  reasoning as 3.0.7's `MediaPlanNotFoundError`) so consumers can map it to a 404
  without string-matching a message.

### Notes
- Purely additive. No existing method changes shape or behaviour.
- Deliberately **not** added: `Campaign.archive()`/`.restore()`/`.delete()` instance
  methods (`Campaign` is a nested sub-model of `MediaPlan` with no storage identity
  or `WorkspaceManager` reference - giving it a lifecycle would mean inventing both);
  a campaign `set_as_current` (a campaign has no current-ness - its plans elect one
  among themselves); and CLI commands (there are no `mediaplan archive` CLI commands
  either, so adding campaign ones would make campaign lifecycle more discoverable
  from the CLI than plan lifecycle).

## [v3.0.10] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- Public schema access: `schema.get_schema()`, `schema.get_schema_bundle()`,
  `schema.get_example()`
  These schemas ship with this package, so this package now serves them. The
  immediate consumer is `planmatic_ask_api`, which re-serves them over HTTP so
  an LLM agent can author a media plan from scratch rather than copying an
  existing one; SDK users get the same access without an API in the loop.

  `get_schema()` returns a **self-contained** document by default. That matters
  because `mediaplan.schema.json` references its siblings by bare filename
  (`{"$ref": "campaign.schema.json"}`) - a convention of this package's own
  `definitions/` layout that no outside consumer can dereference, and that
  every outside consumer would otherwise have to re-implement and keep in step
  with. Resolution lives in the new `schema/refs.py`.

  External (filename) references are **inlined**; local `#/$defs/...` pointers
  are **hoisted** into the result's own `$defs` and rewritten, not expanded in
  place. Expanding them is available via `inline_local=True` but is not the
  default: `dictionary.schema.json` shares one definition across ~35
  custom-field slots, and inlining it at every site takes the resolved media
  plan schema from ~32 KB to ~92 KB, for a consumer that pays per byte of
  context. Hoisted definitions are namespaced by source document
  (`dictionary__custom_field_config`) so that merging several documents cannot
  let one definition quietly shadow another, and definitions nothing reaches
  are dropped.

  `get_example()` **generates** a minimal valid media plan via
  `MediaPlan.create()` rather than returning a stored fixture, so the example
  cannot drift out of sync with the schema - both come from this library at
  this version.

- `examples/examples_16_schemas.py` - worked demonstration of the above. Steps 1-3
  and 6 run with no workspace at all, since the schemas ship with the SDK.

### Fixed
- JSON import now auto-generates `campaign.id` and line item ids, not just
  `meta.id`
  `MediaPlan.create()`, `create_lineitem()` and the Excel importer all minted
  all three ids when absent; the JSON importer minted only `meta.id`. The same
  plan therefore imported cleanly as Excel and failed as JSON, on ids that the
  schema marks required but that no caller has a reason to invent. The
  asymmetry was an incomplete implementation rather than a design choice - the
  helper's own docstring described it as mirroring the Excel importer, which it
  did for one field of three.

  `_ensure_meta_id()` becomes `_ensure_entity_ids()` (the old name is retained
  as an alias). Ids are filled in **only when absent**, so an export -> edit ->
  re-import round trip preserves every id it was given, exactly as `meta.id`
  always has. A plan with no `campaign` block at all is left untouched, so the
  validator still reports that as the schema violation it is instead of it
  being masked by an invented campaign.

  **Scope worth knowing:** the minting is on the JSON *import* path.
  `MediaPlan.from_dict()` builds a model directly and still requires all three
  ids, and `schema.validate()` still reports them missing, since it validates a
  document literally. Both are defensible - they answer different questions from
  "can this be imported?" - but the asymmetry is easy to trip over when reading
  "ids are optional" unqualified. Documented in `SDK_REFERENCE.md` and
  demonstrated in `examples_16_schemas.py` step 5.

## [v3.0.9] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- Excel export crash caused by tz-aware `Meta.created_at` (3.0.8 regression)
  3.0.8 made `Meta.created_at` tz-aware (`datetime.now(timezone.utc)`) to fix a
  real UTC-skew bug - the correct instant, but openpyxl rejects tz-aware
  datetimes outright ("Excel does not support timezones in datetimes"), and
  the metadata sheet wrote `meta.created_at` directly into a cell as a native
  datetime object, crashing every `export_to_excel()` call. The exporter now
  strips `tzinfo` before writing the cell - Excel has no timezone concept for
  datetime cells anyway, so nothing the file format could represent is lost;
  the written value is still the correct UTC instant, just without the
  Python-level tz marker. The importer reattaches `timezone.utc` when reading
  a naive datetime back from that cell, so an export/reimport round-trip
  doesn't quietly regress to an ambiguous naive timestamp - the same failure
  mode 3.0.8's fix addressed in the first place.

---

## [v3.0.8] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- `Meta.created_at` stamped with UTC instead of naive local time
  Both the Pydantic field default and every save()/create()/Excel-import site
  that stamps `meta.created_at` used naive `datetime.now()` - local server
  wall-clock time with no timezone info. Downstream consumers reading or
  displaying the field as UTC saw a reproducible skew equal to the server's
  UTC offset (e.g. a plan created at 23:33:24 on a UTC-4 server recorded
  19:33:23). All five sites that set `meta.created_at` (the `Meta` model's
  field default, `MediaPlan.create()`, `MediaPlan.save()`'s first-save
  timestamp, and both Excel-import fallbacks) now use
  `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. Already-persisted (skewed) values are left as
  historical data - a separate product decision, not part of this code fix.
- `{regex}` filter with `|` alternation silently returning 0 rows
  `_build_sql_filter_conditions()`'s regex branch ran the pattern through the
  generic literal-value sanitizer (`_escape_sql_value()`) before converting it
  to a SQL `LIKE` pattern. That sanitizer's whitelist strips anything that
  isn't alphanumeric/space/`-`/`.`/`:`/`@` - so a pattern like
  `"Meridian|PROC|QA"` had its `|` characters silently removed, becoming
  `"MeridianPROCQA"`, wrapped as `LIKE '%MeridianPROCQA%'` and matching
  nothing. A single term like `"Meridian"` has no special characters to
  strip, so it worked by accident - exactly the reported symptom. Fixing the
  escaping alone wouldn't have been enough, since SQL `LIKE` cannot express
  alternation at all: `{regex}` filters now use each engine's real boolean
  regex-match capability instead - PostgreSQL's `~` operator, DuckDB's
  `regexp_matches(col, pattern)` (DuckDB's own `~` operator silently
  misbehaves for strings, so it can't be shared across both engines). Which
  engine a query will use is now determined up front via a new
  `_get_active_sql_engine()` helper, since the WHERE-clause text is built
  once and can run on either engine depending on `sql_query()`'s routing.
  Verified end-to-end against DuckDB with the exact reported scenario; the
  investigation also ruled out the requirements doc's original suspect
  (`_apply_filters()`'s `pandas.Series.str.match()`), confirming it is
  unreachable dead code in the current SDK.

---

## [v3.0.7] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- `MediaPlanNotFoundError`, distinct from generic `StorageError`
  `MediaPlan.load()`'s only failure mode for a missing plan ID used to be a
  generic `StorageError` built from the full resolved local path (leaking the
  server's absolute filesystem layout) and indistinguishable by type from
  permission errors, corrupted reads, or S3 access failures. `read_mediaplan()`
  now checks file existence up front and raises `MediaPlanNotFoundError` (a
  `StorageError` subclass) with just the relative path. Since it subclasses
  `StorageError`, every existing `except StorageError` catch continues to work
  unchanged.
- `meta_is_archived` in `WorkspaceManager.list_campaigns()`'s SQL output
  `list_mediaplans()` already selected `meta_is_archived` in both its `SELECT`
  and `GROUP BY` clauses; `list_campaigns()` never did, so `include_archived=True`
  correctly changed *which* campaigns came back but no returned row said
  whether that campaign *is* archived. Purely additive — no behavior change for
  callers ignoring the new field.
- Auto-generated `meta.id` on JSON import
  `excel/importer.py` already auto-generates `meta.id` (`mediaplan_{8-hex}`)
  when the Media Plan ID cell is blank; `import_from_json()` had no equivalent,
  so a JSON payload with a missing/null `id` failed Pydantic validation
  outright. `import_from_json()` now applies the same convention immediately
  before validation, at the import call site only — `from_dict()`/`load()`/
  `clone()`/migration are unaffected, since a missing `id` there indicates
  corruption of an already-saved plan rather than a new import.
- `ValidationError.errors()` passthrough
  `mediaplanpy.exceptions.ValidationError` now exposes a `.errors()` method
  returning pydantic's structured per-field error list (field, message, input)
  when available, instead of only a flattened string message.

### Fixed
- JSON-import validation failures no longer double-wrapped into `StorageError`
  `import_from_json()` caught its own `ValidationError` (already built from
  pydantic's message, dev URL included) and re-wrapped it a second time into
  `StorageError`, discarding pydantic's structured `.errors()` list and
  collapsing the distinction between "the input data is invalid" and "a real
  storage/IO problem occurred." Genuine data-validation failures now propagate
  as `ValidationError` with `.errors()` intact; the schema-version-mismatch
  case still maps to a friendly `StorageError` as before.
- SQL filter values quoted by column type instead of guessed from value shape
  `_build_sql_filter_conditions()` decided whether to quote a scalar filter
  value based on whether the Python value looked numeric, not the target
  column's actual SQL type — a filter like
  `{"campaign_workflow_status_id": "1"}` (a `varchar` column, string value
  that looks numeric) was emitted unquoted, which Postgres rejected with
  `operator does not exist: character varying = integer`. Exact-match and
  range filters now quote based on the column's declared type from the
  canonical schema (`storage/schema_columns.py`); columns outside that schema
  keep the previous guess-from-value-shape behavior.
- Postgres error misclassified as a workspace-isolation error
  `_sql_query_postgres`'s exception handler classified *any* database error
  mentioning `"workspace_id"` anywhere in its text as a workspace-isolation
  problem. Since `_add_workspace_filter()` injects a `workspace_id` predicate
  into every query, and Postgres embeds the full failing SQL in its error
  text, that substring was present in essentially every SQL error regardless
  of cause — so an unrelated type mismatch (see above) was mislabeled as a
  workspace isolation error. The classifier now inspects psycopg2's structured
  diagnostics (`diag.column_name` / `pgcode`) instead of substring-matching
  the full error text.

## [v3.0.6] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- `include_archived` parameter on `WorkspaceManager.list_mediaplans()`
  Previously, `list_mediaplans()` had no archived-filtering concept at all —
  it always returned every media plan, archived or not, with no native way
  to exclude them. The new `include_archived` parameter defaults to `True`
  (preserving current behavior byte-for-byte, unlike `list_campaigns()`'s
  `include_archived` default of `False`, which matches *its* pre-existing
  always-exclude behavior). Setting `include_archived=False` adds a
  `WHERE meta_is_archived = FALSE OR meta_is_archived IS NULL` clause,
  mirroring the NULL-safe pattern already used by `list_campaigns()` — plans
  that have never been explicitly archived or restored (`meta_is_archived`
  is `NULL`) are still included. Purely additive — existing callers are
  unaffected.

---

## [v3.0.5] - 2026-08-12

### Added
- `include_archived` parameter on `WorkspaceManager.list_campaigns()`
  Previously, `list_campaigns()` hardcoded the exclusion of archived campaigns
  (`meta_is_archived = FALSE OR meta_is_archived IS NULL`) with no way to
  override it. The new `include_archived` parameter (default `False`, preserving
  current behavior byte-for-byte) allows callers to opt in to seeing archived
  campaigns. Purely additive — existing callers are unaffected.
- `allow_current` parameter on `MediaPlan.archive()`
  Archiving a campaign has always been implemented client-side as a loop over
  the campaign's plans, but that loop could never complete: `archive()` always
  raised on the campaign's current plan, and every campaign has one. The new
  `allow_current` parameter (default `False`, preserving current behavior and
  error message byte-for-byte) lets callers explicitly archive a current plan
  as part of a campaign-level cascade. When used, `is_current` is preserved
  (not cleared), so `restore()` reinstates the plan as current with no
  re-election step. Intended for campaign-level cascade archival only — see
  the `archive()` docstring for the caveat on using it against a single plan
  of an otherwise-live campaign.
- Relaxed the `is_current`/`is_archived` mutual-exclusion invariant
  Removed the "cannot be both current and archived" checks in
  `Meta.validate_model()` and `SchemaValidator._validate_meta_v2_consistency()`.
  These flags answer different questions (which plan is authoritative vs.
  whether it's active) and are only contradictory for plan-level archival,
  which the default `archive()` guard above continues to prevent. No JSON
  Schema change — the constraint was SDK-side only.
- `MediaPlan.load(campaign_id=...)` now resolves archived campaigns
  Internally passes `include_archived=True` to `list_campaigns()` so that a
  campaign whose current plan has been archived (via `allow_current=True`)
  remains loadable by `campaign_id` — required for the campaign-archive-cascade
  UI flow to view/restore an archived campaign.

---

## [v3.0.4] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Excel export of metric values on aggregate line items (`is_aggregate=True`)
  Aggregate rows store summary values directly rather than deriving them from
  a base metric and coefficient. The exporter previously applied the standard
  `=IF(cpu=0, 0, cost_total/cpu)` formula path to these rows, which evaluated
  to 0 when `cost_total=0` — masking the actual stored metric value (e.g.
  `metric_reach` on a campaign-level rollup). Aggregate rows now write metric
  values verbatim and leave coefficient columns blank.
- Excel export of custom metrics without a Dictionary entry
  When a custom metric (e.g. `metric_custom1`) had no entry in the plan's
  Dictionary, `metric_custom*_cpu` columns were created (defaulted to
  `cost_per_unit`) but never populated with a coefficient, so the metric's
  formula referenced an empty cell and evaluated to 0. The coefficient
  population logic now applies the same `cost_per_unit` default as column
  creation, so the values round-trip correctly.

---

## [v3.0.3] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **`adbudg` formula type**: New diminishing-returns response curve formula for metrics.
  Formula: `metric_value = coefficient * base^parameter2 / (parameter1 + base^parameter2)`.
  Supports forward calculation, reverse coefficient solving, and full Excel round-trip
  (export/import) with coefficient, parameter1, and parameter2 columns.

---

## [v3.0.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- `MediaPlan.load(campaign_id=...)`
  Loading a media plan by `campaign_id` now correctly resolves the campaign's current media plan via `workspace.list_campaigns()` and loads it by its `meta_id`. Previously, `load()` incorrectly attempted to open a file named after the campaign ID, which does not exist. The deprecation warning has been removed as this is a valid and common use case.

### Added
- `examples/examples_04_load_mediaplan.py`
  New `load_by_campaign_id()` example demonstrating how to load a media plan using a campaign ID, including how the SDK resolves the campaign to its current media plan behind the scenes.

---

## [v3.0.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- `MediaPlan.save()`
  No longer resets `meta.created_at` when overwriting an existing media plan. The original creation timestamp is now preserved across saves; `created_at` is only set on the initial save.
- `SchemaMigrator`
  Migration from v2.0 to v3.0 now preserves the original `meta.created_at` value. Migration metadata (source version, target version, migration timestamp) is recorded in `meta.custom_properties.schema_migration`.
- `Workspace.list_campaigns()`
  Fixed invalid SQL generated when user-specified filters were applied. The `_add_sql_filters` helper now correctly appends conditions with `AND` when a `WHERE` clause already exists, rather than producing a duplicate `WHERE` keyword.

### Security
- `Workspace.sql_query()`
  Blocked SQL workspace isolation bypass via `UNION` operators, subqueries, and multi-statement queries. User-supplied SQL is now validated to prevent cross-workspace data access.

### Improved
- `examples/examples_08_list_objects.py`
  Updated to make proper use of the SDK list methods' built-in filter parameters (`list_mediaplans()`, `list_campaigns()`, `list_lineitems()`), replacing manual post-query filtering.

---

- `MediaPlan.restore(workspace_manager)`  
  Restore an archived media plan by setting `is_archived=False` and updating storage/database accordingly.
- `MediaPlan.set_as_current(workspace_manager)`

- `MediaPlan.save(set_as_current=True)` *(optional argument)*  
  New boolean flag added to the `save()` method to allow setting a plan as current at the time of saving.

### Improved
- `MediaPlan.export_to_excel()`  
  Enhanced layout and formatting of the exported Excel workbook, especially the **Dictionary** and **Documentation** worksheets, for improved readability and compliance with schema documentation standards.

### Fixed
- `MediaPlan.import()`  
  Improved validation to prevent duplicate line item IDs and custom column captions during plan import, ensuring better data integrity.
