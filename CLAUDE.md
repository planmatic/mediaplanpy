## Architecture Overview

MediaPlanPy is a Python SDK for working with media plans that follow the MediaPlan Schema standard. The codebase is organized into several key modules:

### Core Components

**Models (`src/mediaplanpy/models/`)**
- `MediaPlan`: Main model representing a complete media plan with campaigns and line items
- `Campaign`: Represents a campaign with budget and target audience information
- `LineItem`: Individual line items within campaigns with metrics and cost data
- `TargetAudience`: New v3.0 model for audience arrays with 13+ attributes
- `TargetLocation`: New v3.0 model for location arrays with multiple targeting options
- `MetricFormula`: New v3.0 model for calculated metric formulas
- All models inherit from `BaseModel` and use Pydantic for validation
- Models support schema v3.0 with v2.0 migration capability

**Schema Management (`src/mediaplanpy/schema/`)**
- Version-aware schema validation and migration system
- Supports schema version 3.0 with v2.0 migration support (v0.0 and v1.0 no longer supported)
- `SchemaValidator`: Validates media plans against schemas
- `SchemaMigrator`: Migrates v2.0 → v3.0 with automatic audience/location restructuring
- `SchemaRegistry`: Manages schema definitions stored in `definitions/` subdirectories
- `refs.py` + `get_schema()`/`get_schema_bundle()`/`get_example()` (v3.0.10): serve those
  definitions to outside consumers — see "Schema Exposure" below

**Storage (`src/mediaplanpy/storage/`)**
- Pluggable storage backends: Local filesystem, S3, Google Drive, PostgreSQL
- Format handlers for JSON, Excel, and Parquet files
- `read_mediaplan()` and `write_mediaplan()` are the main entry points
- Storage configuration is managed through workspace settings

**Workspace Management (`src/mediaplanpy/workspace/`)**
- Multi-environment configuration system
- Workspace configurations define storage locations and database connections
- Query functionality across multiple media plans within a workspace
- Workspace validation against JSON schemas

**Excel Integration (`src/mediaplanpy/excel/`)**
- Import/export functionality for Excel files
- Template-based Excel generation
- Excel validation against schema requirements
- Custom formatting and style handling

### Key Patterns

**Schema Versioning**
- The system supports schema version 3.0 as current, with v2.0 migration support
- Version detection is automatic from media plan metadata
- v2.0 → v3.0 migration handles audience/location restructuring and new field additions
- v0.0 and v1.0 are no longer supported

**Schema Exposure (v3.0.10)**
- `schema.get_schema()` returns a **self-contained** document. The on-disk
  `mediaplan.schema.json` references its siblings by bare filename
  (`{"$ref": "campaign.schema.json"}`) — a convention of this package's own
  `definitions/<version>/` layout that no outside consumer can dereference. Resolution lives
  in `schema/refs.py` for that reason: re-implementing it elsewhere breaks silently the first
  time these files are reorganised.
- External (filename) references are **inlined**; local `#/$defs/...` pointers are **hoisted**
  into the result's own `$defs` and retargeted, not expanded. `dictionary.schema.json` shares
  one definition across ~35 custom-field slots, so expanding in place takes the media plan
  schema from ~32 KB to ~92 KB. `inline_local=True` still offers full expansion. Hoisted names
  are namespaced by source document (`dictionary__custom_field_config`) so merging documents
  cannot let one definition shadow another.
- The property consumers rely on is `contains_external_ref()` — "points at nothing you cannot
  reach" — not a blanket "no `$ref` anywhere".
- `get_example()` **generates** its example via `MediaPlan.create()` rather than returning a
  fixture, so it cannot drift from the schema. Do not replace it with a stored file.
- Primary consumer: `planmatic_ask_api` re-serves these over HTTP (`GET /schemas/{entity_type}`),
  which `planmatic_mcp` proxies as its `entity_schema` tool.

**Id generation on import**
- `_ensure_entity_ids()` in `models/mediaplan_json.py` mints `meta.id`, `campaign.id` and each
  `lineitems[].id` when absent, matching `MediaPlan.create()`, `create_lineitem()` and the Excel
  importer. Before v3.0.10 only `meta.id` was minted, so an identical plan imported as Excel and
  failed as JSON.
- Ids are filled **only when absent**, which is what makes export → edit → re-import safe.
- This is on the **JSON import path only**. `MediaPlan.from_dict()` still requires all three, and
  `schema.validate()` still reports them missing — it validates a document literally. Both are
  defensible (they answer different questions) but the asymmetry surprises people; keep it in
  mind before documenting ids as simply "optional".

**Database Integration**
- PostgreSQL integration is optional (requires `psycopg2-binary`)
- Database functionality is patched into MediaPlan models when available
- Use `is_database_available()` to check if database features are accessible

**Error Handling**
- Custom exception hierarchy in `exceptions.py`
- All exceptions inherit from `MediaPlanError`
- Specific exceptions for schema, storage, validation, and workspace errors

## Configuration

**Version Information**
- Current SDK version: 3.0.10
- Current schema version: 3.0
- Supported major versions: [2, 3]

**Dependencies**
- Core: pydantic, pandas, jsonschema
- Optional: openpyxl (Excel), psycopg2-binary (PostgreSQL), pyarrow (Parquet), boto3 (S3)
- All dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`

## Testing Notes

- Tests are in `tests/` directory using pytest
- Test files follow `test_*.py` naming convention
- Tests cover models, schema validation, storage backends, Excel functionality, and workspace management
- Use `pytest tests/test_specific.py::TestClass::test_method` to run individual tests
