## Architecture Overview

MediaPlanPy is a Python SDK for working with media plans that follow the MediaPlan Schema standard. The codebase is organized into several key modules:

### Core Components

**Models (`src/mediaplanpy/models/`)**
- `MediaPlan`: Main model representing a complete media plan with campaigns and line items
- `Campaign`: Represents a campaign with budget and target audience information
- `LineItem`: Individual line items within campaigns with metrics and cost data
- `TargetAudience`: New v3.0 model for audience arrays with 13+ attributes
- `TargetLocation`: New v3.0 model for location arrays with multiple targeting options
- `MetricFormula`: New v3.0 model for calculated metric formulas
- All models inherit from `BaseModel` and use Pydantic for validation
- Models support schema v3.0 with v2.0 migration capability

**Schema Management (`src/mediaplanpy/schema/`)**
- Version-aware schema validation and migration system
- Supports schema version 3.0 with v2.0 migration support (v0.0 and v1.0 no longer supported)
- `SchemaValidator`: Validates media plans against schemas
- `SchemaMigrator`: Migrates v2.0 → v3.0 with automatic audience/location restructuring
- `SchemaRegistry`: Manages schema definitions stored in `definitions/` subdirectories
- `refs.py` + `get_schema()`/`get_schema_bundle()`/`get_example()` (v3.0.10): serve those
  definitions to outside consumers — see "Schema Exposure" below

**Storage (`src/mediaplanpy/storage/`)**
- Pluggable storage backends: Local filesystem, S3, Google Drive, PostgreSQL
- Format handlers for JSON, Excel, and Parquet files
- `read_mediaplan()` and `write_mediaplan()` are the main entry points
- Storage configuration is managed through workspace settings
- `get_storage_backend()` caches and reuses backend instances (v3.0.12) - see "Storage
  Backend Caching" below before adding a new call site or a new backend type

**Workspace Management (`src/mediaplanpy/workspace/`)**
- Multi-environment configuration system
- Workspace configurations define storage locations and database connections
- Query functionality across multiple media plans within a workspace
- Workspace validation against JSON schemas

**Excel Integration (`src/mediaplanpy/excel/`)**
- Import/export functionality for Excel files
- Template-based Excel generation
- Excel validation against schema requirements
- Custom formatting and style handling

### Key Patterns

**Schema Versioning**
- The system supports schema version 3.0 as current, with v2.0 migration support
- Version detection is automatic from media plan metadata
- v2.0 → v3.0 migration handles audience/location restructuring and new field additions
- v0.0 and v1.0 are no longer supported

**Schema Exposure (v3.0.10)**
- `schema.get_schema()` returns a **self-contained** document. The on-disk
  `mediaplan.schema.json` references its siblings by bare filename
  (`{"$ref": "campaign.schema.json"}`) — a convention of this package's own
  `definitions/<version>/` layout that no outside consumer can dereference. Resolution lives
  in `schema/refs.py` for that reason: re-implementing it elsewhere breaks silently the first
  time these files are reorganised.
- External (filename) references are **inlined**; local `#/$defs/...` pointers are **hoisted**
  into the result's own `$defs` and retargeted, not expanded. `dictionary.schema.json` shares
  one definition across ~35 custom-field slots, so expanding in place takes the media plan
  schema from ~32 KB to ~92 KB. `inline_local=True` still offers full expansion. Hoisted names
  are namespaced by source document (`dictionary__custom_field_config`) so merging documents
  cannot let one definition shadow another.
- The property consumers rely on is `contains_external_ref()` — "points at nothing you cannot
  reach" — not a blanket "no `$ref` anywhere".
- `get_example()` **generates** its example via `MediaPlan.create()` rather than returning a
  fixture, so it cannot drift from the schema. Do not replace it with a stored file.
- Primary consumer: `planmatic_ask_api` re-serves these over HTTP (`GET /schemas/{entity_type}`),
  which `planmatic_mcp` proxies as its `entity_schema` tool.

**Id generation on import**
- `_ensure_entity_ids()` in `models/mediaplan_json.py` mints `meta.id`, `campaign.id` and each
  `lineitems[].id` when absent, matching `MediaPlan.create()`, `create_lineitem()` and the Excel
  importer. Before v3.0.10 only `meta.id` was minted, so an identical plan imported as Excel and
  failed as JSON.
- Ids are filled **only when absent**, which is what makes export → edit → re-import safe.
- This is on the **JSON import path only**. `MediaPlan.from_dict()` still requires all three, and
  `schema.validate()` still reports them missing — it validates a document literally. Both are
  defensible (they answer different questions) but the asymmetry surprises people; keep it in
  mind before documenting ids as simply "optional".

**Campaigns Are Derived, Not Stored**
- There is no campaign file, no campaign record, and no stored campaign state.
  `WorkspaceManager.list_campaigns()` (`workspace/query.py`) derives its rows entirely
  from media plan files: it filters archived *plans* out at the SQL level, then keeps
  one row per `campaign_id` taken from that campaign's current/latest plan.
- Consequences, all load-bearing: a campaign is "archived" exactly when **every** one
  of its plans is archived (archiving some leaves the campaign fully visible from a
  survivor); a campaign ceases to exist when its last plan is deleted; and every
  campaign lifecycle operation is therefore a **cascade over plans**.
- `WorkspaceManager.archive_campaign()` / `restore_campaign()` / `delete_campaign()`
  (`workspace/campaign_lifecycle.py`, v3.0.11) implement that cascade. They are
  non-atomic and continue-on-error, returning `plans_changed`/`plans_skipped`/
  `plans_failed` rather than hiding a partial result.
- This is not an implementation shortcut — it is the only semantics the storage model
  can express. Do not "fix" it by inventing a campaign record.

**Storage Backend Caching (v3.0.12)**
- `get_storage_backend()` used to construct a brand-new backend on every call.
  `LocalStorageBackend.__init__` is free (just path resolution), but
  `S3StorageBackend.__init__` builds a boto3 client and performs a live
  `head_bucket()` connectivity check - a real network round-trip. Several
  downstream packages call `get_storage_backend()` many times per logical
  operation (every settings read/write, every entity reload), so each one paid
  for the same connectivity check repeatedly within a single request.
- The cache lives in `mediaplanpy/storage/__init__.py`, module-level (not on
  `WorkspaceManager`), because every known caller constructs a fresh
  `WorkspaceManager` and a fresh resolved-config dict per call - an
  instance-scoped or identity-keyed cache would never hit in practice.
- **Cache key is content, not identity or `workspace_id` alone**: `(workspace_id,
  mode, json.dumps(storage_config[mode], sort_keys=True))`. `workspace_id` is
  included even though it lives outside `storage.*` because `S3StorageBackend`
  defaults its `prefix` to `workspace_id` when `storage.s3.prefix` is unset -
  two workspaces with identical `storage.s3` blocks but different ids must not
  share a backend. If a backend class is added whose behavior depends on a
  config field outside `storage.<mode>` and `workspace_id`, the cache key must
  be extended to cover it or that field will be silently ignored for caching
  purposes - this is the one thing to check before adding a new backend type.
- Bounded + LRU (`_BACKEND_CACHE_MAXSIZE`, default 64) so a long-running
  multi-tenant server can't grow this cache without limit. A failed
  construction is never cached - the next call retries from scratch.
- `clear_storage_backend_cache()` forces fresh instances process-wide. Needed
  after rotating credentials a cached backend has no way to notice on its own
  (static env-var credentials aren't re-read after client construction;
  profile- and IAM-role-based credentials refresh themselves and don't need
  this).

**Excel Round-Trip Fidelity (v3.0.13)**
- Goal: JSON -> Excel -> (edit, recalculate) -> JSON loses nothing. `tests/unit/test_excel_roundtrip.py`
  pins it; tests needing formula results run the workbook through LibreOffice and skip without it.
- **Labels and headers are a contract between `excel/exporter.py` and `excel/importer.py`.** Every
  pre-3.0.13 loss came from the two drifting apart (`Custom Properties:` vs `Custom Properties (JSON):`,
  `Location List` vs `Location List (JSON)`). When renaming a label, keep the old one readable in the
  importer: workbooks already exported are in users' hands.
- The importer coerces every line-item field starting with `cost_`/`metric_` to float. A non-numeric
  field with those prefixes must be listed in `NON_NUMERIC_COST_METRIC_FIELDS` or it is silently dropped.
- `metric_formulas` on import = the `Metric Formulas (JSON)` column **merged under** what
  `_build_metric_formulas_from_import()` rebuilds from sheet values (`_merge_metric_formulas()`). The
  sheet wins for coefficient/parameters (that is where users edit); everything else in the JSON column
  is kept. Never go back to replacing the column outright.
- **Absent != 0.** For a field a line item lacks, the exporter leaves the `%`/coefficient cell blank and
  wraps formulas as `=IF(x="","",...)` (the blank test must be outermost: Excel treats blank as 0);
  the importer reads a blank result as absent. A recalculated blank result reads back as `None`, the same
  as a never-calculated cell, which is why `_warn_if_formulas_uncalculated()` only warns when **no**
  formula cell has a cached value (openpyxl drops all cached values on save, so this is all-or-nothing
  in practice).
- Lists in cells are JSON arrays, never comma-joined (`"Los Angeles, CA"`).
- `meta.schema_version` comes back as `"3.0"` (not `"v3.0"`) after an Excel cycle - documented, not a bug.

**Database Integration**
- PostgreSQL integration is optional (requires `psycopg2-binary`)
- Database functionality is patched into MediaPlan models when available
- Use `is_database_available()` to check if database features are accessible
- String columns are `TEXT` (v3.0.14; were `VARCHAR(255)`, which silently dropped plans with
  longer values). The SDK never alters an existing table: tables created earlier stay
  `VARCHAR(255)` until migrated by hand (SQL in CHANGE_LOG v3.0.14). Keep it that way - automatic
  DDL against shared Stage/Prod databases is a deployment decision, not an SDK side effect.

**Error Handling**
- Custom exception hierarchy in `exceptions.py`
- All exceptions inherit from `MediaPlanError` - including `SQLQueryError` since v3.0.14 - and
  every class is exported from the package root. Define exceptions only in `exceptions.py` and
  import them elsewhere: a same-named local class (as `workspace/loader.py` had until v3.0.14)
  makes `except mediaplanpy.<Name>` silently catch nothing.
- Specific exceptions for schema, storage, validation, and workspace errors
